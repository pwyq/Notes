Today is Sept. 29th, 2022, I'm at the UAlberta Speedwell Grad Residence.
The commit date of `MLPedia.md` was on Jan. 26th, 2018, when I was first exposed to RL at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.
That day I got home and wrote down all the fancy jargon I overheard at work.
Despite my intern job not being on RL, I knew that I would devote myself to this field.
I was so excited.
I was so excited about the journey that I would embark on.

I decided to keep this sub-directory during today's repo re-organization, so as to remind me of the first excitement of RL for me.
